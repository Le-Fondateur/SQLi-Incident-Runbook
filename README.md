# 🛡️ SQL Injection Attack Incident Response Runbook

Welcome to the **SQL Injection Attack Incident Response Runbook**! This repository is designed as your go-to guide for handling SQL Injection incidents in an organized and effective manner, guiding security teams step-by-step through phases of detection, containment, and recovery. SQL Injection remains one of the most prevalent database attack vectors, targeting vulnerabilities in SQL query handling and posing serious threats to data integrity and security.

**This runbook equips your team to:**
- 🚨 **Detect early signs of attack** using suspicious SQL patterns, unusual database activity, and error messages.
- 🔍 **Analyze** the potential impact with an in-depth forensic approach to assess vulnerabilities and data compromise.
- 🔒 **Contain the attack** quickly, minimizing damage through strategic isolation and mitigation.
- 💾 **Recover data integrity** with streamlined processes to bring your systems back to stability.

## 🌟 Runbook Highlights

This runbook is more than just an incident response guide – it’s your tactical toolkit for SQL security. Key features include:

- **Phase-Based Workflow**: Seamlessly flow from detection to containment and recovery in clearly defined stages.
- **Clear Actionable Steps**: Each step is broken down for quick response under pressure, ensuring that every action is purposeful and efficient.
- **Real-World Scenarios**: The runbook includes specific examples and threat models, making it adaptable to different environments and attack scales.

## 🚀 SQL Injection Incident Response Overview
The runbook follows a structured response approach divided into four critical phases:

### 1. Detection Phase
**Goal**: Identify signs of SQL Injection, such as unusual query activity and repeated error messages.<br>
**Methods**: Monitoring logs, scanning for specific error types, and observing high-frequency queries.
### 2. Analysis Phase
**Goal**: Conduct forensic analysis to determine the attack scope and assess which assets may be compromised.<br>
**Methods**: Review historical queries, analyze entry points, and document compromised data.
### 3. Containment Phase
**Goal**: Isolate the compromised systems to prevent the attack from spreading.<br>
**Methods**: Implement firewall rules, restrict user access, and apply patches or temporary query constraints.
### 4. Recovery Phase
**Goal**: Restore data integrity and secure the environment for ongoing operation.<br>
**Methods**: Back up and restore databases, perform integrity checks, and conduct a post-incident review to prevent future attacks.
