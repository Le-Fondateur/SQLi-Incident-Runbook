# SQL Injection Attack Incident Runbook

## Overview
SQL Injection is a type of attack where malicious SQL statements are injected into an entry field for execution, which can potentially compromise the security of the entire database. This runbook provides a structured response to SQL Injection incidents, covering detection, analysis, containment, and recovery phases. Each phase includes detailed steps to effectively mitigate the impact of an SQL Injection attack.

## 1. Detection Phase

### Description
The detection phase focuses on identifying abnormal database activity, repeated error messages, and suspicious SQL queries that could indicate an SQL Injection attempt.

### Steps to Detect
1. **Identify Abnormal Database Activity**: Monitor for unusually high activity on database servers, such as repeated SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE operations.
2. **Repeated Error Messages**: Identify repeated SQL errors like syntax errors or database connection issues, which can indicate that SQL injection is being attempted.
3. **Suspicious SQL Queries**: Use SQL logging to detect queries that contain SQL injection patterns, such as "OR 1=1", "UNION SELECT", or nested subqueries.

### Scripts
- **`abnormal_db_activity_detector.py`**: Script to monitor abnormal database activities.
- **`error_message_detector.py`**: Script to analyze logs for repeated error messages.
- **`suspicious_sql_query_detector.py`**: Script to identify suspicious SQL queries.

## 2. Analysis Phase

### Description
The analysis phase focuses on investigating logs, analyzing query access patterns, and identifying which queries may have been injected by an attacker.

### Steps to Analyze
1. **Investigate Logs**: Review database and application server logs to identify injected queries.
2. **Query Access Pattern Analysis**: Analyze user access and query patterns to understand which entry points were exploited.
3. **Identify Injected Queries**: Extract specific queries that have been injected and determine how the database was affected.

### Scripts
- **`log_investigator.py`**: Script to parse and analyze database logs.
- **`query_pattern_analyzer.py`**: Script to analyze user query patterns.
- **`injected_query_identifier.py`**: Script to identify injected queries and assess their impact.

## 3. Containment Phase

### Description
The containment phase aims to prevent further SQL Injection attacks by applying Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules to block malicious inputs and filter SQL queries.

### Steps to Contain
1. **Apply WAF Rules**: Configure the WAF to block SQL-specific payloads and common SQL injection signatures.
2. **Block Malicious Inputs**: Use input validation techniques to filter out SQL injection attempts.
3. **Rate Limiting**: Apply rate limiting to prevent repeated automated SQL injection attempts from the same IP address.

### Scripts
- **`apply_waf_rules.sh`**: Bash script to apply WAF rules to block SQL injection attempts.
- **`input_filter.py`**: Script to sanitize user inputs to prevent SQL injection.

## 4. Recovery Phase

### Description
The recovery phase focuses on patching vulnerabilities, sanitizing user inputs, and performing thorough code reviews to prevent future SQL Injection attacks.

### Steps to Recover
1. **Patch Vulnerabilities**: Update the application to patch any identified vulnerabilities that allowed SQL injection.
2. **Sanitize User Inputs**: Implement input sanitization across the entire application to prevent unvalidated user inputs.
3. **Code Reviews**: Conduct a thorough code review to identify potential SQL vulnerabilities and ensure secure coding practices.
4. **Database Audit**: Audit the database to identify any changes made by the attacker and restore integrity where needed.

### Scripts
- **`patch_vulnerabilities.py`**: Script to patch application vulnerabilities.
- **`sanitize_inputs.py`**: Script to sanitize all user inputs.
- **`code_review_tool.py`**: Script to automate part of the code review process for SQL vulnerabilities.
- **`database_audit.py`**: Script to audit the database and restore integrity.

## Flowchart
- Refer to the flowchart in the **/flowcharts/** directory for a visual representation of the SQL Injection response process, including detection, analysis, containment, and recovery workflows.

## Post-Incident Activities
- **Post-Mortem Analysis**: Conduct a post-mortem analysis to understand how the SQL Injection attack occurred and determine necessary improvements.
- **Update Runbook**: Update this runbook with lessons learned to enhance future response.
- **Internal Training**: Provide training to developers on secure coding practices and SQL injection prevention.

## Tools & References
- **WAF Tools**: Use tools like ModSecurity to configure Web Application Firewall rules.
- **SQL Logging Tools**: Use SQL logging tools to capture and analyze queries for potential vulnerabilities.
- **Code Review Tools**: Use tools like SonarQube to conduct automated code reviews.

## Summary
This runbook provides a structured approach to handling SQL Injection incidents, ensuring effective detection, analysis, containment, and recovery. By following these steps, SOC analysts and developers can mitigate the impact of SQL Injection attacks and strengthen the organization's resilience against such threats.
